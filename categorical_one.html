            How do we display data for a single category?

            <p>
            For the article, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/non-voters-poll-2020-election/">Why Many
            Americans Don't Vote</a>, five thirty eight conducted a survey online to ask Americans about their
            voting habits. They also collected demographic information including education level. We will look at
            the education level of people who voluntarily answered the survey to determine if there might any bias
            (this is known as volunteer bias) in who participates. The three visualizations below all
            show the exact same data. We want to figure out which one is most effective in making the main point.
            </p>

            <p>
            The purpose of the visualization is to show that most of the people who responded to the survey went to
            college (even if they didn't graduate). About 70% of respondents did attend college, while 30% did not.
            Notice that in all of the plots, gray is used for the No College category - this is done purposefully to
            draw attention to the larger group that did attend college.

            The <dfn>waffle plot</dfn> has 100 blocks in it and the number of shaded blocks represents the percentage
            in each group, so the number of blocks is what we use to compare group size. The actual number of
            individuals is provided in the annotations (this is true for all plots). The <dfn>donut chart</dfn> uses
            arcs of a circle to show the group size, while the <dfn>bar chart</dfn> uses the length of the bars. It
            is harder for a viewer to make sense of radial or circular data - if the numbers weren't there would you
            be able to tell me accurately the difference in the size of the arcs? It's tough. Given that we only
            have three values to show, the bar chart may be the best choice, since it uses less space to show the
            data and allows for a quick comparison by the viewer. However, we would still need to think for a minute
            to add together the two blue bars. With a waffle plot, we can count out the values exactly, we see the
            grouping of the two blue sections right away, and we can do this quickly for values out of 100, but it
            is more difficult to comprehend for other totals.
            </p>        
            <p> 
            You may be wondering, so what's the right answer? The answer is, it depends. If you are low on space, the
            bar chart is a great choice - it is compact, doesn't use much ink and clearly makes the point. The
            waffle plot may be faster for a viewer to comprehend for a round number like 100. While the donut chart
            is perhaps the hardest to decipher intuitively, donut charts can catch the viewers eye and use space
            effectively by allowing for the main message in the center. In general, the donut chart is least
            preferable in terms of truthfulnessâ€¦and please NEVER use a pie chart!
